# Machine-learning-for-population-generation
A synthetic population is an artificial data set, which preferably has the characteristics of a real population.  
In order to do this as well as possible, the synthetic population created must be as close as possible to a real population, which means that the individuals in the data set 
should have realistic characteristics. However, people often do not live exclusively as isolated individuals, but in households with other people. Simply ignoring the household 
level would make many analyses very unreliable. One particular difficulty here is the creation of such a realistic household structure, i.e the generation of 
"correlation structures of persons within a household. If persons within a household are simulated without any social links, then strange results 
- for example five babies in a five-person household - may appear." (Münnich and Schürrle, 2003, 4). The present work addresses these difficulties. Our goal will be to 
create a complete, as realistic as possible synthetic population with realistic household structure. In any case, machine learning methods are used, which seem to be
particularly promising for this purpose, as the interrelationships within households are non-linear and interactive. We assume that the starting point will always be a 
household sample from the real population, on the basis of which our strategies will be developed, applied and tested.
